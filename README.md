# Neural-Networks-Classifications

## Introduction
Project which shows various methods that can be used for classification of simple datasets, using various type of generic machine learning models such as :
1. Single Perceptron Classification
2. Multiple Perceptron Classification
3. Multiple Perceptron Multiple Classes Classification
4. Logistic Regression
5. Deep Neural Networks

### Note
The Programs are written using Keras library running on Tensorflow 2.1
