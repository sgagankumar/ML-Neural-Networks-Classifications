# [Neural-Networks-Classifications](https://sgagankumar.github.io/ML-Neural-Networks-Classifications/)

## Introduction
Project which shows various methods that can be used for classification of simple datasets, using various type of generic machine learning models such as :
1. [Single Perceptron Classification](https://github.com/sgagankumar/ML-Neural-Networks-Classifications/blob/master/Perceptron.ipynb)
2. [Multiple Perceptron Classification](https://github.com/sgagankumar/ML-Neural-Networks-Classifications/blob/master/Multiclass.ipynb)
3. [Multiple Perceptron Multiple Classes Classification](https://github.com/sgagankumarML-Neural-Networks-Classifications/blob/master/Multiclass2.ipynb)
4. [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/sgagankumar/ML-Neural-Networks-Classifications/blob/master/Logistic%20Regression.ipynb)
5. [Deep Neural Networks](https://github.com/sgagankumar/ML-Neural-Networks-Classifications/blob/master/DeepNeuralNetwork.ipynb)

### Usage
Download the python notebook file and open it with Jupyter Notebook or [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb).
Run the Algorithms to Analyse and Understand the working for the various classification algorithms graphically.

### Note
The Project is written on [Python 3.8.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
The Programs are written using Keras library running on [Tensorflow 2.1](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
