# Neural-Networks-Classifications

## Introduction
Project which shows various methods that can be used for classification of simple datasets, using various type of generic machine learning models such as :
1. Single Perceptron Classification
2. Multiple Perceptron Classification
3. Multiple Perceptron Multiple Classes Classification
4. Logistic Regression
5. Deep Neural Networks

### Usage
Download the python notebook file and open it with Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory.
Run the Algorithms to Analyse and Understand the working for the various classification algorithms graphically.

### Note
The Programs are written using Keras library running on Tensorflow 2.1
Following are the prerequisite python packages to run the machine learning algorithms
1. numpy
2. matplotlib
3. ten
4. keras
5. sklearn
